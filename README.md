Please contact Hankui Peng (hp467@cam.ac.uk) if you have any question.


## Prerequisites
The training code was mainly developed and tested with Python 3.8.5, PyTorch 1.7.0, OpenCV 4.4.0, and Ubuntu 20.04. We recommend the user to run the code in a clean environment, and create a new conda environment in the terminal: 
```
conda create -n DAL-HERS python=3.8.5 anaconda

conda activate DAL-HERS 
```
Then the user may need to install a few other Python packages, such as pytorch, torchvision, opencv, etc. These packages can be installed with pip in terminal. 


## Model set-up
Download the pretrained Deep Affinity Learning (DAL) model from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14-uaeMAihLdMepfZAth19T1pfZIoMcaE/view?usp=sharing) and put it under the ```pretrained``` folder in the project repository.


## Building HERS module in Python
Type the following in terminal under the main project repository:
```
make module 
```
This would create ```./pybuild/hers_superpixel.*.so```, which can then be imported directly in Python as ```import hers_superpixel```.


## Testing
We provide code to generate superpixel segmentation results (in .csv and .png) for a folder of input images given: 1) a sequence of numbers of desired superpixels and 2) a specific number of superpixels. For testing, we provide 10 sample images from the BSDS500 data set in ```./sample_imgs/input/``` as input.

To produce segmentation results for various numbers of superpixels, run in terminal: 
```
bash analysis_multi_nC.sh
```

To produce segmentation results for a given number of superpixels, run in terminal: 
```
bash analysis_single_nC.sh
```

To test on other data sets,  please first collect all the images into one folder ```<CUSTOM_DIR>```, and then convert them into the same format (e.g. ```.png``` or ```.jpg```) if necessary. Then, simply modify the ```INPUT_DIR``` parameter within ```analysis_multi_nC.sh``` or ```analysis_single_nC.sh``` and follow the instructions above.


## Evaluation
We use the code from [superpixel benchmark](https://github.com/davidstutz/superpixel-benchmark) for superpixel evaluation. A detailed  [instruction](https://github.com/davidstutz/superpixel-benchmark/blob/master/docs/BUILDING.md) is available in the repository.
